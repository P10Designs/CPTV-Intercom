# HOW IT WORKS #

* Client Side
  - Firstly you introduce your name and code given by the admin
  - Secondly the controller screen shows up and you have full access to the app

* Server Side
  - Once server is initiated, admin has access to itÂ´s panel
  - Here the admin can create users to connect to the app, and give them privileges or roles
  - After that the admin gives the code to the user and this one connects to the app.
  - The server then handles calls between users
